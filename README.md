Zero-knowledge encrypted distributed filesystem ("EasySafe")

This is the code I've written for my project "EasySafe" that many of you have heard me talk about. I've decided that since it is not making progress being held in a private repo, and since my intention was always to open source it anyway, I should at least make it public.

At this time, I have not selected a license. Intuitively, I lean towards something like AGPL, but I am concerned that the wrong license selection will impact the environment of the project and be difficult to undo later. So for now, the code is just here. There's no license. I ask that you please not deploy this or include the code places without speaking to me at this time, though the intent is to make this open source.

In time I hope to return to this project, with the care and attention it deserves.
