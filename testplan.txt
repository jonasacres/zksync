Crypto tests:
  - BLAKE2 test vectors (with and without key)
  - AES-256-OCB test vectors (encrypt and decrypt)
  - Argon2i test vectors (don't actually exist, so compare to Ruby)
  - BLAKE2-HKDF test vectors (also probably don't officially exist, so compare to Ruby again)

Key tests:
  - derive (make sure it matches Ruby)
  - wrappedEncrypt (with and without padding)
  - wrappedDecrypt
  - encrypt (with and without padding)
  - decrypt
  - authenticate
